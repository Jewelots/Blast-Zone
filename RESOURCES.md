Resources Used
==============

 * Player, powerup, and block sprites are from “Bomberman Tournament (GBA)”
 * Paper texture used in background of game seemingly originated from this website http://lazystarhorsecompany.com/contact-2/dirtypaper-2 but they may be omitting the source of it's original location. The resource is used so much around the internet that copyright status is unknown. Definitely would not use in commercial product, but since this was an entirely non-commercial educational effort it should be okay.
 * Music and sound effects from “Wario Blast (Feat. Bomberman) (GBC)”
 * Font used in the game is “Badaboom”
